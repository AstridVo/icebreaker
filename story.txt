Another peaceful night working diligently on my studies for SER316, with a belly full of doener and my neighbors Porsche still safely undetected in my garage, but before I could begin my work you'll never believe what happened!
I find out that a complete baffoon from the neighbouring town of Raesfeld decided to hijack a plane from a flughafen in Berlin, while wearing a dirndl mind you, and is currently planning something even more insane!
