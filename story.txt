My buddy tried to order a Bratwurst in his best German. Somehow he ended up asking for a Brot with Lederhose—much to the waiter’s confusion.

We got lost near the Hauptstraße but eventually found a Ratskeller serving Apfelkuchen that tasted like heaven.

Later that night, we danced in the Festhalle until sunrise, fueled by endless Bratwurst and a questionable amount of Sauerkraut.

At the Flughafen, we almost missed our flight because someone insisted on buying a Dirndel from a vending machine.

To pass the time, we entered a Wettbewerb at a nearby Bäckerei to see who could eat the most Gebäck in one minute.

The prize was a vintage BMW brochure and a very suspicious-looking Klimaanlage manual signed by a man named Mehlhase.

As we waited for our ride, a golden retriever wearing a tiny Schloss key around his neck barked at a passing Doener cart.

In celebration, we cranked up some Rammstein and raced down the Autobahn in a rented Porsche.

The road signs made no sense, but we trusted the GPS, which insisted we take a  turn into a Biergarten.

There we met some strangers, declared ourselves wettbewerbsfähig, and vowed never to mix up Bratwurst and Brot again.
