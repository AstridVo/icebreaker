My buddy tried to order a Bratwurst in his best German. Somehow he ended up asking for a Brot with Lederhose—much to the waiter’s confusion.

We got lost near the Hauptstraße but eventually found a Ratskeller serving Apfelkuchen that tasted like heaven.

Later that night, we danced in the Festhalle until sunrise, fueled by endless Bratwurst and a questionable amount of Sauerkraut.

At the Flughafen, we almost missed our flight because someone insisted on buying a Dirndel from a vending machine.

Amazingly, the dirndel fit me... until I made the mistake of going back for another Doener (worth it).
